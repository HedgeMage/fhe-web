## So, is this a liberal thing or a conservative thing?

Neither.  Both.  We're non-partisan, but we're hardly apolitical.  We believe strongly in:

- Freedom of expression for everyone: rich, poor, old, young, annoying, odious, ahead of their time, resistant to change, peacemakers, instigators, credentialed, common, and especially those deemed unworthy.
- Freedom of association for and with everyone.
- That these and other freedoms cease to exist when we cannot choose what of ourselves to share and with whom.  Privacy is the right which ensures all the rest are possible, especially for those without power or popularity to defend them.
